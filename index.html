                                    <p>Easyreadwrite Workshops are designed to improve the quality of life for people over fifty five by adding another dimension to the range of activities and services on offer for people as they age. Language skills empower and enable us to communicate, to forge links, make connections and express our view of the world we live in.</p>
                                    <p>With Easyreadwrite Workshops Theresa McKenna designs and presents a series of themed workshops which incorporate oral, written and reading activities in an enjoyable and entertaining format to stimulate and engage people as they age. Theresa is an English Teacher. She has been teaching for over thirty years, and is passionate about positive ageing, lifelong learning and literature. </p>
                                    <p>Engaging with language can help prevent and delay the onset of conditions such as Alzheimer’s and Dementia. The social interaction involved in a Workshop helps promote better mental health and wellbeing. Workshops will enrich the lives of the participants through enjoyable language activities, designed around themes. Methodologies and content of the workshops is tailored to suit the individual needs of people in Retirement Villages, Nursing Homes, Day Care Centres, Resource Centres and Community Halls. Memoir, autobiographical writing, biography, short story writing, novel, diary, research, magazine/newspaper article, letter, poetry and drama or other genre can be explored in the workshops.</p>
                                    <p>It is most important that the individual needs of the group are met and they engage in the activities in a way that is comfortable and enjoyable for them. Speaking about our growing older population in Ireland Dr. Stephanie O’Keefe, HSE National Director, Health and Wellbeing referred to tapping into the wealth of knowledge and experience, engaging and capturing the views and experience of our older citizens.</p>
                                    <p>“Tapping into the wealth of knowledge and experience of this key demographic is vital as we aim to put in place services that will efficiently meet the needs of our changing population in the future. With the number of those aged 65 and over projected to increase by 167% to 1.42 million people by 2046, this demographic is growing approximately 20,000 a year and will have increased by 111,200 people in 2022. It is vital we engage and capture their views and experiences.</p>
